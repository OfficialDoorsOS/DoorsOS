            <ul>
                <li>How does an OS work?</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>An OS(Operating system) is a series of small(but complicated) programs that allow programs to
                        run on computers using a baseline compatibility expectation. </li>
                </ol>
                <li>What is Linux?</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Linux is an Open-Source operating system that shares a clear goal of development through
                        baseline file tree systems and kernel development, as well as its philosophy of open-source
                        programs. It is an alternative competitor to MacOS and Windows, though in a much more
                        customizable way.</li>
                </ol>
                <li>What is DoorsOS?</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>DoorsOS is our operating system, built using the GCC 14.2 compiler, which turns source code into
                        programs that a computer can run in conjunction with Rust, C, C++, or more.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <li>How did we prep?</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>We prepped by installing proxmox on an old 2008-era server to use to compile LFS at first. With
                        24 cores and 256GB of DDR2-800 ram it seemed perfect, although plenty dated. In addition, we set
                        up several virtual machines in order to prep the project. Later, whenever we decided to compile
                        on a personal computer, we also used a USB-hard drive and prepped the system by using the
                        pre-installed partition in order to compile and build LFS very quickly due to the architectural
                        improvements from several generations of improvements.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </ul>

        <div id="MLFS">
            <h3>MLFS: (3-4 Weeks)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>What is MLFS?</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>MLFS is the first process by which we build the operating system, relying on the first initial
                        host system in order to build the first few programs using its own compiler, before building GCC
                        in parts(2 passes) and Coreutils, the 2 most important programs for building and running the
                        entire system. Coreutil provides the expected functionality for the Operating system, and GCC
                        provides the base in which to compile programs easily as one of the most popular compilers for
                        linux.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <li>What is Compiling?</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Compiling is the process in which GCC or other compilers translate source code into binary
                        programs for computers to execute or build. We will show you a demonstration now of building a
                        program if you would turn your attention to the other monitor.</li>
                </ol>
                <li>What does it look like?</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Much like the terminal window you see to your right, with minital applications and no GUI,
                        purely command line. Reduced functionality than the system before you since we have compiled
                        many applications that add many commands afterwards, but we do not have a screenshot of the
                        system that we can show you other than that.</li>
                </ol>
                <li>Why did it take us restarting 2 times?</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Lack of experience is to blame, as the first restart was due to an accidental deletion of GCC,
                        and during the second run we figured out that transferring it to the host computer(which was
                        another intel machine), it had been compiled with the incorrect settings due to the various
                        differences in infrastructure within he 2(server processor chips from 2008 vs consumer processor
                        chips from 2014, plus all the motherboard and ram differences), in which some of the OS was
                        found to be completely dysfunctional. This combined with the uncertainty of wether this was the
                        cause of KDE failing(which we will talk about later), lead to 2 restarts, each restart being
                        much much faster than the previous attempt.</li>

            <h3>GLFS: (1-2 Weeks)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>What is GLFS?</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>GLFS is the first edition of “Icing on the OS”. GLFS is designed to allow systems to run popular
                        gaming applications such as steam and wine. It does this through a mix of Graphic Drivers, audio
                        files, and other important dependencies.</li>
                </ol>
                <li>What is Steam and Wine?</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Steam is the most popular gaming application by far in which to play video games, buy them,
                        trade items within them, or download mods for various approved games. It owns somewhere between
                        60-80% of the gaming market for desktop PC’s and is seeing an introduction into consoles soon
                        with the Xbox. </li>
                    <li>WINE is the program that is used on Unix-based operating systems(such as MacOS and Linux) to run
                        windows programs that are not kernel-level, and is acknowledged as one of the reasons that Linux
                        is as popular as it is today(somewhere between 2-10% market share of desktop PC’s)</li>
                </ol>
                <li>What does it look like?</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Very similar to MLFS, but the applications themselves we can bring up on the screen to your
                        right if you would like. Steam is the only application that has a GUI, WINE does as well but
                        only when running windows programs that also have GUIs. </li>
                </ol>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div id="BLFS">
            <h3>BLFS: (5-6 Weeks)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>What is BLFS?</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>BLFS is the rest of the “Icing on the OS”. BLFS contains many different dependencies with
                        varying use-cases. For example, we downloaded our GUI and some Quality of life dependencies
                        through BLFS. Because of the size of BLFS we only downloaded what we needed, barely scratching
                        the surface of the “optimization” and QOL dependencies that BLFS offers.</li>
                </ol>
                <li>What is our desktop interface?</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>XFCE is the Desktop Environment we decided to install. This allows us to make the system much
                        more user-friendly by giving them a way to graphically, rather than textually, interact with the
                        system. It also has the unique advantage of being as close to Windows 11/10 as possible, being
                        easy to manage and navigate for a new user (though we do not recommend this for a new user)
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <li>Why did we restart BLFS so many times?</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>We restarted BLFS due to an incompatibility of KDE to start, which we later found out was due to
                        the fact that KDE(another desktop environment that was the originally had intended to use)
                        couldn’t find it’s coreutils, a problem that we couldn’t fix due to a lack of time or looking at
                        logs. As a result, we tried re-compiling KDE several times, and then attempted to compile
                        Hyprland, to no success due to Hyprland refusing to run as a root account(we did not have a
                        secondary user account at the time.). Eventually, we found success with XFCE as you see before
                        you. </li>
                </ol>
                <li>What does it look like?</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>What it looks like is what you see before you, as we minimize all of our applications. </li>
                </ol>
